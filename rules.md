    1.  Disclaimer
        1.  TLDR stands for "too long didn't read".
        1.  This section is intended to be a brief summary of the rules.
        1.  If a conflict exists between this section and another section below, this section will be invalid.

        1.  Managers, especially the commissioner, should be competitive, but friendly.
1.  <a id="teams">Yahoo! Sports Settings and Rules</a>
    1. Many settings are configured on the Yahoo! Sports Fantasy Football platform and have been removed from this rules document. The settings on the app are the source of truth for these. These settings include, but are not limited to the following:
        1. Scoring settings
        1. Roster positions

1.  <a id="draft">Draft</a>
    1.  Date and time
        1.  The draft time will be the Sunday before the first game of the season.
            1.  This date will be determined on August 1 as the day the NFL projects the first game will be played.
    1.  Order
        1.  Draft order will be determined by manager's choice in an order determined by the previous year's standings.
            1. Choice order and deadlines
                1. 7th place from previous year may choose any draft position by 10am, 4 days before the draft.
                1. 8th place from previous year may choose any remaining draft position by 12pm, 4 days before the draft.
                1. 9th place from previous year may choose any remaining draft position by 2pm, 4 days before the draft.
                1. 10th place from previous year may choose any remaining draft position by 4pm, 4 days before the draft.
                1. 11th place from previous year may choose any remaining draft position by 6pm, 4 days before the draft.
                1. 12th place from previous year may choose any remaining draft position by 8pm, 4 days before the draft.
                1. 5th place from previous year may choose any remaining draft position by 10am, 3 days before the draft.
                1. 6th place from previous year may choose any remaining draft position by 12pm, 3 days before the draft.
                1. 4th place from previous year may choose any remaining draft position by 2pm, 3 days before the draft.
                1. 3rd place from previous year may choose any remaining draft position by 4pm, 3 days before the draft.
                1. 2nd place from previous year may choose any remaining draft position by 6pm, 3 days before the draft.
                1. 1st place from previous year will be assigned the only remaining draft position.
            1. Setting preferences and defaults
                1. Any manager may post a list of draft position preferences publicly to the league at anytime and the most preferred draft position in their preference list will be automatically selected for them.
                1. If a manager does not choose their draft position by their draft position by their assiigned deadline, the lowest remaining draft position will be assigned.
    1.  <a id="keepers">Keepers</a>
        1.  Starting in the 2022 season, managers may elect to keep players from previous seasons within the limitations laid out in this section.
        1.  Keeper elections must be made by end of day, 5 days before the draft.
        1.  Cost of keeping a player
            1.  The first year a player is kept, they will cost one draft round less than the round they were drafted the previous year.
                1.  For example a player drafted in the 5th round, will cost a 4th round pick the following year.
                1.  An undrafted player will cost a last round pick the following year.
                1.  A first round pick cannot be kept the following year.
            1.  The second year a player is kept, they will cost a first round pick unless they cost a first round pick the previous year, in which case they cannot be kept a second year.
            1.  No player may be kept 3 consecutive drafts, nor may a player be kept in one draft if they cost a 1st round pick ni the previious draft.
            1.  Players acquired through FA, WW, or trades will retain their draft round (or lack of draft round) for the purposes of determining their cost the keep the following year.
        1.  Teams may not keep any combination of players who's total draft round costs exceed 15.
            1.  Examples
                1. Keeping players who cost a 10th and 5th round pick totals 15. This is allowed.
                1. Keeping players who cost a 12th, 3rd, and 1st round pick totals 16. This is not allowed.
        1.  If you choose to keep multiple players who cost the same draft round, you may pay a lesser draft round.
            1.  Such changes do not reduce the cost of keeping a player for the sake of determining whether the total costs exceed 15.
            1.  Such changes do affect the round that a player costs to keep next year and could result in making the player unkeepable next year if a 1st round pick is sacrificed  year.
1.  <a id="schedule">Schedule</a>
    1.  <a id="regular-season">Regular Season</a>
        1.  The schedule will be randomly determined before keepers and draft picks are selected at the start of the season.
            1. Commissioner will use the best tools reasonably available to randomize the schedule and do his best to show that it was truly random.
        1.  The following criteria will be enforced when randomizing the schedule:

        1.  Playoffs will take place during weeks 15 through 17.

            1.  No money prizes will be awarded in the losers bracket, but draft order will be determined as perscribed by the draft section of the rules.

1.  <a id="moves">Moves</a>
    1.  Moves are defined as player adds, trades, and drops.
    1.  Players may only be dropped by a manager if the manager intends to immediately replace the slot on his or her roster.
    1.  <a id="trades">Trades</a>
        1.  Trades may only involve two teams.
            1.  Threeway trades may be proposed or discussed, but the managers must work out a way to execute the trade in multiple steps using only two managers at a time.
            1.  During the multipart execution of a threeway trade, managers may object to any component trade, independant of the other trades. Furthermore, managers are not beholden to any agreement to make a trade in the future based on the conditions of any previous trade. For these reasons, threeway trades can never be guarenteed.
        1.  Tradebacks and double trades are disallowed
            1.  Tradebacks are when a manager makes a trade to gain a player that he or she once traded away without the player falling to Waivers or Free Agency between trades.
            1.  Double trades are when a manager trades a player that was acquired in a different trade less than 24 hours prior.
            1.  Tradebacks and double trades will be reversed immediately without a vote provided that a single manager points out that a tradeback or double trade occured within 24 hours of such trade.
        1.  Expedited Trades
            1.  Trades are processed immediately by Yahoo, but our rules states that trades may be objected within 24 hours after the trade is made and a vote to overturn a trade may take up to 36 hours after the trades is made.
            1.  Managers who make a trade to acquire a player less than 36 hours before they are expected to play may make [conditional moves or roster modifications](#conditional-moves) to be prepared for the case that their trade is objected and overturned.
1.  <a id="objections">Objections</a>
    1.  Any move may be objected by any manager within 24 hours after the move is made.
        1.  For trades this period starts when the trade is initiated; not processed.
    1.  <a id="undoubtably">Undoubtably bad moves</a>
        1.  A manager must not take any actions, including making moves and setting active players, such that at the time the action is initiated it undoubtably diminishes the value of his or her team by reducing such team's chances of making the playoffs, finishing the regular season with the best possible seed, and leaving the team in a good state for subsequent seasons.
            1.  Such actions may include, but are not limited to:
                1.  Leaving roster positions empty when a healthy alternative was available on the bench or free agency (FA).
                1.  Putting a player on active roster that has been long known to be not participating in the given week.
                1.  Dropping an exceptionally valuable player when a significantly lesser valued alternative player was available to be dropped.
                1.  Letting go of obviosuly high valued keeper players in exchange for no meaninigful gain.
            1.  Exceptions may include:
                1.  Pulling (or not pulling) a player from active roster after the manager's team has gained a lead that would be at risk if the player scored negative points.
                1.  In rare cases, leaving a roster position empty because no alternative exists on the bench and no benched player is worth dropping.
            1.  A successful objection regarding a roster decision to activate a specific player shall result in that players position on the roster being filled using the [autopilot](#autopilot) protocol.
            1.  Commissioner may make executive decisions at gametime to put a team on autopilot in cases of extraordinary neglect to prevent a league vote from delaying the correction.
                1.  Comissioner will do his best to notify and get approval from as much of the league as possible before such decisions.
                1.  A league vote may reverse these executive decisions.
    1.  Waiver abuse
        1.  If a player is suspected of dropping and picking up players from free agency for the sole significant purpose of moving players to waivers, any moves made to accomplish this may be objected.
        1.  An exception may be made if the league determines by a majority vote that the player was scrambling "last-minute" to assemble a viable scoring team with incomplete information.
        1. Dropping a player to waivers shall never be considered waiver abuse if the player has already started their game for the week or would have otherwise been placed on waivers automatically by Yahoo.
    1.  Initiating an objection
        1.  A manager may declare their intention to object by posting a new thread in the league message board stating the intention to object.
        1.  An objection is not considered initiated until another manager seconds the intention to object.
        1.  Both the original intention to object and the seconding of the intention to object shall count as vote in favor of the objection.
        1.  Whenever an objection is initiated, the commissioner will clearly explain the situation publically to the league and outline the procedure for resolving it.
        1.  When an objection is initiated, each manager in the league will have until 24 hours after the time the objection is initiated to perform a majority league vote to determine the outcome of the objection.
    1.  If an objection vote passes, the commissioner will do his best to reverse the actions that have been done as a result of the objection.
        1.  In some cases, this may include reversing other actions by other teams, if they are determined by a majority league vote to have been responses to the original objected action.
        1.  In the case that multiple actions need to be reversed, they will be determined in forward chronological order.
    1.  <a id="suspending-moves">In order to prevent multiple objections, the commissioner may suspend certain actions, including but not limited to moves, during a league vote until the vote is complete.</a>
        1.  The commissioner will do his best to act quickly to finish an objection vote, in an attempt to avoid suspending moves.
    1.  <a id="conditional-moves">Conditional Moves and Roster Modifictions</a>
        1.  In the event moves are suspended or a vote is in progress that will affect a managers ability or willingness to make a move, managers may request to conditionally, based on the outcome of the objection vote, make a move.
        1.  Conditional moves or roster modifictaions can be made by clearly stating the intention in the league message board or by communicating it to the commissioner who will then publically add it to the league message board.
            1. Commissioner gives no guarentee that he will act quickly in this situation as his number 1 priority will be to lift the suspension and/or resolve the league vote.
        1.  Conditional moves will be processed after the objection vote in the order which they were publicly communicated to the league message board. For this reason, managers are encouraged to post it themselves, rather than wait for the commissioner.
        1.  Managers should not consider specific conditional moves or roster modifications made after an objected move when voting on such objection.
    1.  Any use of the word "veto" or derivations thereof in this document or in the Yahoo interface including the message board shall be interpreted as having the same meaning as an objection unless otherwise stated.
1.  <a id="voting">Voting</a>
    1.  For any reasonable dispute that requires a league vote, the commissioner will gather and post all relevant information and make an initial ruling which shall be binding unless any manager objects in a reasonable time.
    1. A league vote will only occur following an objection or other dispute if seconded by another manager.
        1. In the case that a manager seconds an objection, that manager must vote in favor of the objection.
