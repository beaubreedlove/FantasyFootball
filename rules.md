        1.  All times are Eastern Time (ET).
        1.  Managers, especially the commissioner, should be competitive, but friendly.

        1.  7 Teams will qualify for the playoffs.

                    1. This choice must be made on or before 1:00 PM (ET) on the Tuesday before the games, or the choice will default to the bottom seed.
                1.  The top remaining seed (seed 3 or 4, whichever was not chosen by seed 2) chooses their opponent from the remaining teams.

                    1.  Loser is 4th place
        1.  Losers Bracket
            1.  A 7 team losers bracket will be set up for teams that do not make the playoffs (seeds 8-14).
            1.  Losers bracket seeding will use the same tie-breaking method as regular season seeding, except total wins and ties will be ignored and the primary seeding method will be [winning/losing streaks](#winning-streaks).
            1.  Losers bracket opponent selection follows the same rules as the main playoffs:
                1.  Week 14: Seed 9 chooses first (by 1:00 PM ET Tuesday), then the top remaining seed among 10-14 chooses (by 4:00 PM ET Tuesday).
                1.  Week 15: Seed 8 chooses among the winners (by 1:00 PM ET Tuesday).
        1.  Playoff choice delays
            1.  If the NFL or Yahoo causes a matchup to be incomplete by the time playoff opponent choices are due, or Yahoo delays waivers, then the choice deadline will be delayed until the first day after the matchups are complete or until the last day before the new waiver date.
        1.  FAB bonuses
            1.  Each team that makes the playoffs will receive the same amount of FAB they started the season with credited on top of their existing balance at the start of week 14.

1.  <a id="moves">Moves</a>
    1.  Moves are defined as player adds, trades, and drops.
    1.  Players may only be dropped by a manager if the manager intends to immediately fill the slot on his or her roster.
    1.  <a id="trades">Trades</a>
        1.  Trades may only involve two teams.
            1.  Three-way trades may be proposed or discussed, but the managers must work out a way to execute the trade in multiple steps using only two managers at a time.
            1.  During the multipart execution of a three-way trade, managers may object to any component trade, independent of the other trades. Furthermore, managers are not beholden to any agreement to make a trade in the future based on the conditions of any previous trade. For these reasons, three-way trades can never be guaranteed.
        1.  Tradebacks and double trades are disallowed
            1.  Tradebacks are when a manager makes a trade to gain a player that he or she once traded away without the player falling to Waivers or Free Agency between trades.
            1.  Double trades are when a manager trades a player that was acquired in a different trade less than 36 hours prior.
            1.  Tradebacks and double trades will be reversed immediately without a vote provided that a single manager points out that a tradeback or double trade occurred within 24 hours of such trade.
        1.  Expedited Trades
            1.  Trades are processed immediately by Yahoo, but our rules state that trades may be objected to within 24 hours after the trade is made and a vote to overturn a trade may take up to 36 hours after the trade is made.
            1.  Managers who make a trade to acquire a player less than 36 hours before they are expected to play may make [conditional moves or roster modifications](#conditional-moves) to be prepared for the case that their trade is objected and overturned.
1.  <a id="objections">Objections</a>
    1.  Any move may be objected to by any manager within 24 hours after the move is made.
        1.  For trades this period starts when the trade is processed by Yahoo.
    1.  <a id="undoubtedly">Undoubtedly bad moves</a>
        1.  A manager must not take any actions, including making [moves](#moves) and setting active players, such that at the time the action is initiated it undoubtedly diminishes the value of his or her team by reducing such team's chances of making the playoffs, finishing the regular season with the best possible seed, or winning the current matchup.
            1.  Such actions may include, but are not limited to:
                1.  Leaving roster positions empty when a healthy alternative was available on the bench or free agency (FA).
                1.  Putting a player on active roster that has been long known to be not participating in the given week.
                1.  Dropping an exceptionally valuable player when a significantly lesser valued alternative player was available to be dropped.
            1.  Exceptions may include:
                1.  Pulling (or not pulling) a player from the active roster after the manager's team has gained a lead that would be at risk if the player scored negative points.
                1.  In rare cases, leaving a roster position empty because no alternative exists on the bench and no benched player is worth dropping.
            1.  A successful objection regarding a roster decision to activate a specific player shall result in that players position on the roster being filled using the [autopilot](#autopilot) protocol.
            1.  Commissioner may make executive decisions at gametime to put a team on autopilot in cases of extraordinary neglect to prevent a league vote from delaying the correction.
                1.  Commissioner will do his best to notify and get approval from as much of the league as possible before such decisions.
                1.  A league vote may reverse these executive decisions.
    1.  Waiver abuse
        1.  If a player is suspected of dropping and picking up players from free agency for the sole significant purpose of moving players to waivers, any moves made to accomplish this may be objected.
        1.  An exception may be made if the league determines by a majority vote that the player was scrambling "last-minute" to assemble a viable scoring team with incomplete information.
        1. Dropping a player to waivers shall never be considered waiver abuse if the player has already started their game for the week or would have otherwise been placed on waivers automatically by Yahoo.
    1.  Initiating an objection
        1.  A manager may declare their intention to object by posting in the league chatroom stating the intention to object.
        1.  An objection is not considered initiated until another manager seconds the intention to object.
        1.  Both the original intention to object and the seconding of the intention to object shall count as vote in favor of the objection.
        1.  Whenever an objection is initiated, the commissioner will clearly explain the situation publicly to the league and outline the procedure for resolving it.
        1.  When an objection is initiated, each manager in the league will have until 24 hours after the time the objection is initiated to perform a majority league vote to determine the outcome of the objection, but the entire process must complete within 36 hours of the original trade.
    1.  If an objection vote passes, the commissioner will do his best to reverse the actions that have been done as a result of the objection.
        1.  In some cases, this may include reversing other actions by other teams, if they are determined by a majority league vote to have been responses to the original objected action.
        1.  In the case that multiple actions need to be reversed, they will be determined in forward chronological order.
    1.  <a id="suspending-moves">In order to prevent multiple objections, the commissioner may suspend certain actions, including but not limited to moves, during a league vote until the vote is complete.</a>
        1.  The commissioner will do his best to act quickly to finish an objection vote, in an attempt to avoid suspending moves.
    1.  <a id="conditional-moves">Conditional Moves and Roster Modifictions</a>
        1.  In the event moves are suspended or a vote is in progress that will affect a manager's ability or willingness to make a move, managers may request to conditionally, based on the outcome of the objection vote, make a move.
        1.  Conditional moves or roster modifications can be made by clearly stating the intention in the league chatroom or by communicating it to the commissioner who will then publicly add it to the league chatroom.
            1. The commissioner gives no guarantee that he will act quickly in this situation, as his number one priority will be to lift the suspension and/or resolve the league vote.
        1.  Conditional moves will be processed after the objection vote in the order which they were publicly communicated to the league chatroom. For this reason, managers are encouraged to post it themselves, rather than wait for the commissioner.
        1.  Managers should not consider specific conditional moves or roster modifications made after an objected move when voting on such objection.
1.  <a id="voting">Voting and Objections</a>
    1.  The commissioner will be the sole interpreter of all rules.
    1.  For ambiguous situations not clearly covered by the rules, the commissioner will first check for precedent from past rulings or deleted rules that may still be part of common league understanding.
    1.  If no precedent exists, ambiguous situations will be resolved by majority league vote.
    1.  League votes should be completed within 24 hours with each team manager voting yes (to make some change) or no (to keep things as they are).
    1.  Managers may abstain from a vote.
        1. Managers who abstain will have their vote counted as a "no" for any votes lasting less than 24 hours.
            1. For example, a rushed trade objection due to the 36-hour overall limit.
        1. At 24 hours, managers who haven't voted will neither count for, nor against the proposal.
    1.  Majority votes shall pass if at least half of the teams who didn't abstain, vote yes.
        1. A majority vote shall pass immediately when this condition is met.
    1.  An objection shall constitute a yes vote to reverse the objected action.
    1.  All votes must be cast publicly, in the league chatroom, unconditionally, unambiguously, and by the manager whose opinion they represent.
        1.  Managers may change their vote at any time by casting a new vote that fits this criteria. The new vote will replace the old vote.
    1.  A majority vote will be required for:
        1.  Objections to trades, undoubtedly bad moves or roster decisions, waiver abuse, and any other moves that may be appropriately objected.
        1.  Disambiguating any rules.
    1.  Managers are disqualified from voting on a particular issue if they are directly involved with what is being voted upon.
        1.  The commissioner may make an initial ruling, but will not participate in the league vote if he is directly involved.
        1.  Managers directly involved include but are not limited to
            1.  Managers gaining or losing players in a trade.
            1.  Managers matched up against a team that's being accused of making poor roster decisions.
        1.  Managers disqualified from voting will implicitly abstain from the vote.
1.  <a id="seeding">Seeding</a>
    1.  Regular Season
        1. Seeding in the regular season will order teams from most to least games won. The top 7 teams make the playoffs.
    1.  <a id="tie-breakers">Tie breakers</a>
        1.  Most ties in regular season
        1.  <a id="winning-streaks">Longest win streak / shortest losing streak to end the season</a>
            1.  Longest winning streak counting backwards from the end of the regular season (i.e., longest win streak to end the year).
            1.  Shortest losing streak counting backwards from the end of the regular season.
            1.  The previous two conditions will be applied iteratively backwards through the season until the tie is broken.
                1.  For example: if two teams both end with 3-game win streaks, we compare their losing streaks before those wins, then their win streaks before those losses, and so on.
        1.  Most points in regular season
        1.  Coin flip.
    1.  <a id="ties">Ties in playoffs</a>
        1.  In the event of a tied game during the postseason, the win will be awarded to the team with the bottom seed.
1.  <a id="abandoned-teams">Abandoned Teams</a>
    1.  Managers should keep an eye on their teams at least once a week, set their lineups in a way that they expect to win their games, and add and drop players to prepare to win more games.
        1.  Managers should stay competitive even if they don't think they can improve their chances of making the playoffs or winning prizes.
    1.  Teams who fail to stay competitive may be declared abandoned and put through the abandoned team protocol if the following conditions are met.
        1.  A manager in the league accuses a manager of neglecting their team.
            1.  The accusing manager should describe the nature of the neglect.
        1.  Such team has at the time of accusation taken action or inaction including roster decisions that has been reversed due to a successful objection.
    1.  A supermajority league vote will take place when a team is placed on abandonment protocol.
        1.  If this vote passes, the accused team will be placed on autopilot.
        1.  For this vote to pass, at least 70% of the managers who aren't already on autopilot, must vote yes.
    1.  <a id="autopilot">Autopilot</a>
        1.  When a team is placed on autopilot, the commissioner will set their line up each week in a predetermined fashion.
        1.  Any conditional moves or conditional roster modifications made by the manager will supersede the following rules provided that they are not successfully objected to.
        1.  At the time of the start of each game, the starting roster will be set to the players on the team or available on FA that have the greatest Yahoo projection. Ties in projections will be broken by coin flip.
        1.  Setting the roster may be done slightly after the game starts so that the projections lock in to their final value before the decision is made and so that any other team not on autopilot may have first dibs on any player.
        1.  If a player must be dropped to accommodate a FA add, the dropped player will be chosen using the following method:
            1.  If at any point, only one player is left, drop him.
            1.  Once enough players are dropped to meet the roster size requirement, stop.
            1.  Exclude dropping any players on Yahoo's can't cut list.
            1.  Exclude dropping any players of any position that would prepare to leave the team in a future state of not being able to fill the team with players projected more than 0 points unless this excludes all players.
            1.  Drop the remaining player with the smallest maximum projected weekly score left of the weeks leading to week 14 in the regular season and 17 in the playoffs.
    1.  The commissioner may at any time call a majority league vote to take a team off autopilot.
    1.  Elective autopilot
