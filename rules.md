        1.  Each player sought via a waiver request will be awarded to the team that placed the highest FAAB and the FAAB will be deducted from that team's FAAB budget.
        1.  FAAB will not be deducted for losing bids.

            1.  In a single week, a team's "worst player" is the active player that scores the least points on a team that fills all roster positions for that week.

    1.  Moves are defined as player adds, trades, and drops.
    1.  A player may not be added from waivers by the same team that dropped him immediately before the waiver period began.
        1.  The team who dropped the player must wait until the waiver period ends before placing a claim on the dropped player.

    1.  <a id="trades">Trades</a>
        1.  Trade deadline
            1.  The trade deadline will be the default set by Yahoo.
        1.  Trades may only involve two teams.
            1.  Threeway trades may be proposed or discussed, but the managers must work out a way to execute the trade in multiple steps using only two managers at a time.
            1.  During the multipart execution of a threeway trade, managers may object to any component trade, independant of the other trades. For this reason, threeway trades are not guaranteed to be "all or none".
        1.  Tradebacks
            1.  Tradebacks are when a manager makes a trade to gain a player that he or she once traded away without the player falling to Waivers or Free Agency between trades.
            1.  Tradebacks will be reversed immediately without a vote if a single manager objects to the trade in 24 hours.
        1.  At least one player must be transferred by each team involved in a trade.

1.  <a id="objections">Objections</a>
    1.  Any move may be objected by any manager within 24 hours after the move is made.
        1.  For trades this period starts when the trade is initiated; not processed.
    1.  Undoubtably bad moves
        1.  A manager must not take any actions, including making moves and setting active players, such that at the time the action is iniated it undoubtably diminishes the value of his or her team by reducing such team's chances of making the playoffs and finishing the regular season with the best possible seed.
            1.  Such actions may include, but are not limited to:
                1.  Leaving roster positions empty when a healthy alternative was available on the bench or free agency (FA).
                1.  Putting a player on active roster that has been long known to be not participating in the given week.
                1.  Dropping an exceptionally valuable player when a significantly lesser valued alternative player was available to be dropped.
            1.  Exceptions may include:
                1.  Pulling (or not pulling) a player from active roster after the manager's team has gained a lead that would be at risk if the player scored negative points.
                1.  In rare cases, leaving a roster position empty because no alternative exists on the bench and no benched player is worth dropping.
            1.  A successful objection regarding a roster decision to activate a specific player shall always result in that player being substituted for the player on the bench with the highest projection who's capable of filling that position. In the case that no player is available, a move to pick up a suitable player from FA may be forced.
            1.  A successful objection to a move that results in a player add shall always result in such player being placed on the waiver wire, whether the player came from waiver wire or free agency, and the waiver date should be the next day if the objection vote passes before 9pm (EST) and in two days otherwise.
    1.  Waiver abuse
        1.  If a player is suspected of dropping and picking up players from FA for the sole significant purpose of moving players to waivers, any moves made to accomplish this may be objected.
        1.  An exception may be made if the league determines by a majority vote that the player was scrambling "last-minute" to assemble a viable scoring team with incomplete information.
        1. Dropping a player to waivers shall never be considered waiver abuse if the player has already started their game for the week or would have otherwise been placed on waivers automatically by Yahoo.
    1.  A manager may initiate an objection by indicating to the league that he or she wishes to do so through any of the following means:
        1.  Posting a new thread in the league message board stating the intent to object.
        1.  Using the trade veto button provided by Yahoo! Sports.
        1.  Contacting the commissioner and stating the manager's intention to object and receiving an acknowledgement of such intention.
            1. Commissioner gives no guarentee that he will respond promptly. For this reason, it's recommended that managers use the message board when they'd like a fast decision.
    1.  Whenever an objection is initiated, the commissioner will clearly explain the situation publically to the league and outline the procedure for resolving it.
    1.  When an objection is initiated, each manager in the league will have until whichever is later of 24 hours after the time the objection is initiated or 48 hours after the time the objected action occurred to perform a majority league vote to determine the outcome of the objection.
    1.  If an objection vote passes, the commissioner will do his best to reverse the actions that have been done as a result of the objection.
        1.  In some cases, this may include reversing other actions by other teams, if they are determined by a majority league vote to have been responses to the original objected action.
        1.  In the case that multiple actions need to be reversed, they will be determined in forward chronological order.
    1.  <a id="suspending-moves">In order to prevent multiple objections, the commissioner may suspend certain actions, including but not limited to moves, during a league vote until the vote is complete.</a>
        1.  The commissioner will do his best to act quickly to finish an objection vote, in an attempt to avoid suspending moves.
        1.  In the event moves are suspended, managers may request to conditionally, based on the outcome of the objection vote, make a move.
        1.  Conditional moves can be made by stating them clearly in the league message board or by communicating them to the commissioner who will then publically add them to the league message board.
            1. Commissioner gives no guarentee that he will act quickly in this situation as his number 1 priority will be to lift the suspension.
        1.  Conditional moves during a suspension will be processed after the objection vote in the order which they were publicly communicated to the league message board. For this reason, managers are encouraged to post it themselves, rather than wait for the commissioner.
        1.  Managers should not consider specific conditional moves when casting their vote on the original objection.
    1. Any use of the word "veto" or derivations thereof in this document or in the Yahoo interface including the message board shall be interpreted as having the same meaning as an objection unless otherwise stated.
1.  <a id="voting">Voting</a>
    1.  For any reasonable dispute that requires a league vote, the commissioner will gather and post all relevant information and make an initial ruling which shall be binding unless any manager objects in a reasonable time.
    1. A league vote will only occur following an objection or other dispute if seconded by another manager.
        1. In the case that a manager seconds an objection, that manager must vote in favor of the objection.
        1. The league vote shall be considered initated at the time the objection occured.
    1.  If any manager objects to the commissioner's initial ruling, a league vote shall be initiated.
    1.  League votes should be completed within 24 hours with each team manager voting yes (to make some change) or no (to keep things as they are).
    1.  Managers may abstain from a vote. In this case their vote will not count for or against the proposal.
    1.  Majority votes shall pass if at least half of the teams who didn't abstain, vote yes.
        1. A majority vote shall pass immediately when this condition is met.
    1.  Unanimous votes shall pass if a majority of managers vote yes and all other managers abstain.
    1.  A unanimous vote will be required for any changes to the rules that may in anyway affect the chances for a manager to win a cash prize.
    1.  An objection shall constitute a yes vote to reverse the objected action.
    1.  All votes must be cast publicly, in the message board, unconditionally, unambiguously, and by the manager who's opinion they represent.
        1.  Managers may change their vote at any time by casting a new vote that fits this criteria. The new vote will replace the old vote.
    1.  A majority vote will be required for:
        1.  Objections.
        1.  Disambiguating any rules.
            1.  The commissioner will determine upon request whether the rule is ambiguous or not. Non-ambiguous rules will only be changed upon unanimous vote.
        1.  Replacing the commissioner.
        1.  Anything else that doesn't explicitly require a unanimous vote.
    1.  Managers are disqualified from voting on a particular issue if they are directly involved with what is being voted upon.
        1.  Commissioner may make initial ruling, but will not participate in the league vote if he is directly involved.
        1.  Managers directly involved include but are not limited to
            1.  Managers gaining or losing players in a trade.
            1.  Managers matched up against a team that's being accused of making poor roster decisions.
        1.  Managers disqualified from voting will implicitly abstain from the vote.
